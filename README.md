# Banter AI social lab

So i started this project from scratch using this boilerplate template, to avoid time loss due to setuping all manually: [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)

The main idea behind this project is to create a playground where developer or just a user can have own social network instance where the user is the only react person that not an AI, all the other aspects are intended to be eazy to customize like number of BOTS, their behaviour, jobs to trigger some activity based on schedule, easy interface for propt injeneering and for sure CRUD functionality to have a GOD mode over BOTS that are learning to have a good banter with human-ish feel to it.

```
this tool does not user real database and all the bots and any personal information that you can share with it can really leave your browser. As well as it cant be used in any social engineering and other activities by using human-like AI conversations. The idea is not to train any models but rather work with the all avaliable information gathered from bots behaviour.
```

# If you wanna start:

```
  git clone git@github.com:27danylos/banterai.git
  cd ./banterai
  npm i -g bun (you can use yarn and npm as well)
